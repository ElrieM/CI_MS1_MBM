# Mind Body Motion Wellness Centre Website

[View live project here](https://elriem.github.io/CI_MS1_MBM/)

This is a business website for the Mind Body Motion Wellness Centre, a fictional fitness centre offering yoga, meditation and tai chi classes. It is designed to be responsive on a range of devices, making it easy to navigate for prospective students and existing students.

The website provides users with information about the process for joining classes, where to locate the gym, instructor biographies and a downloadable timetable.

### Design

#### Colour Scheme

* The main colours, generated from colormind.io, are:
  * Light Shades (background / inverted text colour) - Spring Wood #e1dbcf
  * Light Accent (accent colour) - Hillary #ac9d81
  * Main brand colour - Granny Smith #8d9a9c
  * Dark accent (alternative accent colour) - Toast #9d736b
  * Dark shades (dark on light text colour, background) - Outer Space #334545

#### Typography

* Predominantly 2 fonts were used throughout the website:
  * The Lato font is the main font used throughout the whole website, with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case the font does not import correctly into the site. It is summarised as "Male and female, serious but friendly. With the feeling of the Summer". This fits well with the fitness centre, which should have a calm and inviting feeling, but also reflects the seriousness of wellbeing and health.
  * The Dancing Script font was selected for the quotes and class descriptions. It is described as "a lively casual script where the letters bounce and change size slightly" and ideal for a friendly, informal and spontaneous look. I selected it to bring an elegant playfulness to the design, as a compliment to the seriousness of the Lato font.

#### Imagery

* To make the website stand out, I opted for a full page background on the landing page. For responsiveness, I opted to use different background pictures for tablets and mobiles that scaled better to the device. The bright colours of the outfits, the muted backgrounds and the general beauty of the pictures engages with site visitors, immediately telling the visitor what the organisation is about.
