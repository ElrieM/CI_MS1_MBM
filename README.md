# Mind Body Motion Wellness Centre

View live site [here](https://elriem.github.io/CI_MS1_MBM/)

This static front-end site was created to present information for a fictional wellness centre, offering yoga, meditation and tai chi classes.

The website provides users with information about the process for joining classes, where to locate the gym, instructor biographies and a downloadable timetable.
