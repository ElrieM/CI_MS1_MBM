## 1.3 Design

### Colour Scheme

- The main colours, selected from  a Google search of "Yoga studio colour palette" ([link](https://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/9f/7f/08/9f7f08b1a65027c50519d934f6ff7676.jpg&imgrefurl=https://nl.pinterest.com/pin/526006431486092441/&tbnid=_l_RzFZUJQFdxM&vet=1&docid=LUuDSscJX2s3YM&w=1500&h=1500&source=sh/x/im))
  - Light Shades - Fresh Linen #e1dbcf (header, accents)
  - Light Accent - Calm Pink #f2e5dd (background and accents)
  - Main brand colour - Garden Air #d4e0d6
  - Dark accent - Grateful Green #acbba6 (accents)
  - Dark shades - Moonlight Forest #334545 (text)

- Snapshot of palette image can be viewed [here](docs/readme/other/colour-palette.png).

### Typography

- When searching for fonts, I started by looking for an elegant but playful font type to represent the elegance and fluid movements in yoga, but also try to bring in an element of fun and playfulness to avoid being too "stuffy".
- Once I had selected Dancing Script, I looked at the popular pairings and selected Lato.

- Two fonts were used throughout the website:
  - The Lato font is the main font used throughout the whole website, with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case the font does not import correctly into the site. It is summarised as "Male and female, serious but friendly. With the feeling of the Summer". This fits well with the wellness centre, which should have a calm and inviting feeling, but also reflects the seriousness of wellbeing and health.

  - The Dancing Script font was selected for the quotes and class descriptions. It is described as "a lively casual script where the letters bounce and change size slightly" and ideal for a friendly, informal and spontaneous look. This fits well into the impression I wanted for the website.

### Imagery

- To make the website stand out, I opted for a full page background on the landing page.

- For responsiveness, I opted to use different background pictures for tablets and mobiles that scaled better to that device. 

- The bright colours of the outfits, the muted backgrounds and the general beauty of the pictures engages with site visitors, telling the visitor what the organisation is about and introducing the elegant playfulness of the design.

## 1.4 Structure

- During the research phase, I visited websites from the Netherlands, United Kingdom and United States to find common themes and features;
  - Timetables
  - Class descriptions
  - Class rates, and bundle packages
  - Events, usually with guest speakers or internal instructors but also yoga retreats through affiliate links
  - Facilities and rules at the yoga studio
  - Social media links, most commonly Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, but some websites also had Pinterest and YouTube presence
  - Dutch websites, and websites, often had WhatsApp contacts available

- To meet the needs identified in the User Goals, I felt the best way to present the information would be:
  - Introduction to yoga and meditation, especially for those prospective students that were "looking to try something new" and events on the landing / home page
  
  - On the About page, I put information that I felt gave you more of an overview of the wellness centre:
    - Images of instructors, with short inspirational quotes as their "motto" to give you an idea of the personality / character of the instructor and a list of the types of classes they lead. There was some overlap, and not all the classes that instructors can teach are listed with their names on the schedule. The idea with this is rotation and backup - if a instructor is not able to run their class, another instructor could take their place. It is also not uncommon for yoga instructors to be interested or trained in multiple disciplines.
    - Facilities and FAQs, which covers the topics of what is at the wellness centre, what do you need to bring with you (especially important to a prospective student, showing up to a class when there is no yoga mat available to you would be embarrassing and inconvenient and probably lead to the student never returning, thereby losing their business) and what is expected of you (again avoiding embarrassment, for instance walking into a studio with your shoes on and being reprimanded)
    - An image gallery, which gives you an idea of what to expect when you arrive, a preview of classes and an idea of the feel and space available in the wellness centre classes
  
  - Yoga classes and other classes are described on the Classes page. To make it easier for prospective students to find the right class for them, the yoga classes are split into three different levels - classes suitable for beginners, classes for a slower pace and classes with a faster pace
    - Images of the classes, what to expect in a class and suitability is included on this page

  - A class schedule, with a colour legend that ties into the classes page levels (beginner, slow-paced, fast-paced and other / special classes) and the class tariffs are included in the Schedule and Rates page
    - This is commonplace in a lot of the websites, having rates on the same page as the timetable also means you don't have to click away once you have decided on a class, or classes if you are intending regular classes
    - There is also an option to download a PDF version of the class schedule to print and pin where users most need it (great reminder of upcoming classes you might want to attend)

  - On the Contact page, users can find contact details and an enquiry form
    - Contact details include: telephone numbers (including WhatsApp), a physical address, email address and view the address on Google Maps - when clicking on Google Maps image, Google Maps is opened in a new page and users are able to get directions / navigate to the wellness centre
    - On the Enquiry Form, users submit their contact details and select from a dropdown menu the subject / nature of their enquiry (book a class, book an event, membership inquiries or other queries). This form currently submits to the CI form dump page, but would usually be linked to email addresses that send the form to different inboxes to best address the queries

## 4.3. Further Testing

- The website was tested on Google Chrome, Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge.
- The website was viewed on a variety of devices, including:
  - iPhone Xs,
  - iPhone 11s,
  - Lenovo ThinkPad P53,
  - Toshiba Satellite L850-F33V,
  - Dell Inspiron 15 5515 with 24" Dell monitor.
- Significant testing was performed to ensure all pages linked correctly.
- Friends and family were asked to review the site and documentation to point out bugs and /or user experience issues.

## 4.4 Testing Bugs - Resolved

| Bug Found | Solution |
| --- | ---- |
| Footer on pages with insufficient content to fill the whole page (contact page and 404 page) would not stay fixed at the bottom. | After reading various blogs, I combined a solution from [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-keep-your-footer-where-it-belongs-59c6aa05c59c/) and [Medium](https://medium.com/@zerox/keep-that-damn-footer-at-the-bottom-c7a921cb9551): viewheight set as a minimum height, and using Google Developer Tools, I calculated how much to remove (in pixels) to push the footer to the bottom of the page. |
| Table (Classes schedule) would not scroll left and right. | Reapplied table formatting from [Bootstrap 5.0](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/content/tables/) line by line. |
| Bootstrap elements (Gallery, Accordion, Modal) would not work as expected. | Copied Bootstrap 5.0 scripts to the bottom of all pages. |
| Instructor cards breaking unevenly on Laptop viewpoint | Changed margin and padding and applied flex auto margin to fill spaces evenly. |



## 4.5 Known Bugs

- The website is not optimised for Internet Explorer. No additional work was performed to optimise the site for IE as (extended) support has ended for customers since January 2020 and no further development of IE is expected.
- Dropdown list in Contact page Enquiry form: items highlighted in blue. Could not locate the correct item to change the formatting.
